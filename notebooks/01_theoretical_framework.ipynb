    "\n",
    "After reading the OECD Handbook and the Technical Analysis of The Financial Markets by *John Murphy*, I have decided to have 5 dimensions to measure the attractiveness of a stock.  I will be using the following definition of attractiveness:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dimension | Core question it answers |\n",
    "|-----------|--------------------------|\n",
    "| Financial Strength | Can the company fund itself and pay its bills? |\n",
    "| Growth Potential | Is the business expanding in a healthy way? |\n",
    "| Market Performance | How is the market valuing profits and cash returns? |\n",
    "| Risk & Volatility | How much does the share price swing? |\n",
    "| Liquidity & Trading | How easy is it to buy or sell the shares? |\n",
    "\n",
    "These five dimensions cover the most common factors investors check before buying a stock."

    "\n",
    "Note that I am writing this based off my initial understanding from reading the OECD Handbook and *John Murphy's* book.  I will be iterating on this as I learn more about the data and the indicators.\n",
    "Every Indicator is first scaled from its original range to 0-100. Then the average of the indicators will be used to form each dimension score. The average of the five dimensions will form the final CSIAI score.  This is a simple and transparent structure that is easy to understand and explain. I might use different weights for the indicators and dimensions later, but I will start with equal weights to keep it simple.  I will also test different weighting schemes in later notebooks to see how sensitive the CSIAI is to those changes."

    "* **Concept link** – The indicator must fit only one dimension.\n",
    "* **Data quality** – Meets Eurostat and OECD standards for relevance, accuracy, timeliness, accessibility, interpretability, comparability, and coherence.\n",
    "* **Coverage** – Available for at least 90 percent of the filtered universe on the given day.\n",
    "* **Statistical usefulness** – Shows real variation across companies and low overlap with other indicators (multicollinearity will be checked).\n",
    "* **Update frequency** – Right now I will be using daily data but note that Stock Market data is not available for all companies every day.  I will be using the last available data point for each company.\n",
    "* **Documentation** – Definition, unit, source URL, and refresh schedule will be put in the metadata dictionary and API."
